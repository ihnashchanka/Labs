Look into the eyes
Of children orphaned by the war.
Can we sacrifice
Their tears for goals we're fighting for?
Just tell me why, one reason why
We fight to make our children cry?

Give me day without war,
Just a day to fight no more,
Just a day to stop it all,
Just one day to change the world.
Give me day to tell the cost
Of the lives that we have lost,
And to say we've have enough
Making war instead of love!
